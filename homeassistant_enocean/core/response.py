"""A response is a special form of telegram usually sent by an EnOcean module to the host.

The cases are defined in ENOCEAN SERIAL PROTOCOL (ESP3) - SPECIFICATION, Section 1.9:

 > Case 1 : ESP3 packets of the type RADIO_ERP1, RADIO_SUB_TEL or REMOTE_MAN are bidirectional, that is, after sending a packet (host -> module) it is mandatory to wait for the RESPONSE message, to confirm the telegram has been processed and will subsequently be transmitted.
 After receiving (module -> host) a packet no RESPONSE is required (see RADIO_ERP1 no. <3> and <4>).

 > Case 2 : Only a host sends a ESP3 COMMAND (COMMON, SMART ACK) to an EnOcean module. Each REQUEST is answered with a RESPONSE message (OK, error, etc.). The reverse direction module-to-host is not possible.

 > Case 3 : Only an EnOcean module sends an EVENT to a host.The type of the EVENT defines whether a RESPONSE message is required or not.
